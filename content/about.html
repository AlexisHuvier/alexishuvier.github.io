		<strong>I've been coding and messing with computers since I was 10.</strong>
		Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, C/C++, Lua... Throughout the years, I learned a lot of languages.
		And I still do today.

	<h2>self-educated.</h2>

		Sometimes people ask me where and how I learned all this stuff.
		<strong>I learned everything on my own</strong>, by reading courses online and <strong>experimenting <em>a lot</em></strong>.

	<p>
		Although coding is the main thing I do on my computer,
		<strong>it isn't the only thing I'm interested in</strong>.
		Electronic music, design, UX and I sometimes enjoy learning about hardware.
